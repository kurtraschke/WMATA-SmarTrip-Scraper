* Where do gaps in transaction sequence numbers come from?
  * The Farragut Crossing appears to cause a sequence jump,
    as the final exit transaction never shows up (or at least
    this was the case on the first day)
    Open question: retest, both West to North and North to West,
    and see if this is still a problem
  * Bus fareboxes whose clocks are off will also cause
    what looks like a jump, since transactions are ordered
    by timestamp when downloaded.  Ordering the transactions
    by sequence number results in the right order, but
    then the timestamps jump.
    Open question: do the Odyssey fareboxes get their
    clocks reset when probed?
  * Sometimes transactions just never show up,
    including Metrorail transactions, which are normally
    quite reliable.
  * I used my SmarTrip card in MTA Maryland territory once before 
    the official CharmCard launch, and that produced a transaction
    sequence jump.

* How can we uniquely identify transactions when the sequence number
  wraps at 16?

* Early data (July 2010) sometimes has a null Product; this
  is obviously the stored value purse, but why isn't it listed 
  as such?

* What's an ALPO?  Board presentation explains: "Account Linked Products"

* Why are all MTA Maryland transactions reported with an entry location
  of "Central Computer"?
  Open question: is MTA Maryland still on Nextfare 4?  If so, is this why
  Directed Autoload isn't supported in MTA Maryland territory along with
  the other data anomalies?  And what's the upgrade timeline?

* Can we get a real API for this data? Please?
