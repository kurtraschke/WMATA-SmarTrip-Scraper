Updates to support multiple purses, SQLite storage by Kurt Raschke (@kurtraschke)

Simple python script that scrapes a SmarTrip user's transit usage data from WMATA website (http://smartrip.wmata.com)
Script authenticates into WMATA website using mechanize library and then extracts data from HTML tables using BeautifulSoup library then writes to a SQLite database.

Enjoy!
