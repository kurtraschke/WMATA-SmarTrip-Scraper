* Clarify license
* Fix for multiple cards so all cards can be fetched at once
* Fix so we can fetch one month at a time
* Figure out what needs to be done to re-fetch the current month to get latest transactions
  * Easy, lazy solution: blow away all transactions for the current month and re-insert them all
* Package for distribution; dependencies are BeautifulSoup, mechanize, sqlalchemy
* Map Metrorail station names to GTFS stop_id values so we can use that to get lat/lon
* Build some kind of data-mining tool on top? Perhaps at least provide some recommended queries.
  * select count(*), entry, exit
    from transactions
    where operator='Metrorail' 
          and exit is not null 
          and entry is not null 
    group by entry, exit 
    order by count(*) desc;
  * select count(*), operator, description
    from transactions
    group by operator, description
    order by count(*) desc;
  * select *
    from transactions t1 
    where (t1.sequence+1) % 16 != (select t2.sequence
                                   from transactions t2 
                                   where t2.id > t1.id 
                                   order by id asc 
                                   limit 1);
